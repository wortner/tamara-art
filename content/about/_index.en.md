*lifelong art lover*

Physiotherapist and artist Tamara Wortnerová 
i ne
(*1984, České Budějovice) 

Presents her works created over the past two years, which can be seen as an imprint of her experiences and moments from this period — including the birth of her second son, Samuel. In her works on handmade paper, she combines pencil drawing and acrylic painting, complemented by gold leaf, which serves as a unifying thread throughout most of her pieces. Working with gold is nothing new for the artist — she used it frequently on earlier canvases as well. She perceives gold as an imprint of pure living and is able to use it with great ease and freedom.
